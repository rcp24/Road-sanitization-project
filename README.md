# Road-sanitization-project
In this pandemic situation , we need to sanitize our roads as well as daily contact surfaces on large scale , so here I have this quite simple automatic road sanitization car!!
## Components Used In Circuit
* Arduino Uno R3
* DC Motors (4)
* Motor driver (L293D)
* Micro Servo (2)
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
* PIR sensor
* LEDs
* Resistors
* Breadboard
## Working
* **Arduino** is the brain of our project. Car is automatic because of inbuilt timer !! 
* **L293D motor driver** is controlling four DC motors which are used to run the car .
* Two **servo motors** are used :
  * One to rotate the Spray left and right to sanitize road/shops/surfaces on both sides.
  * Other to press the nob of Spray 
    >( A thread will be attached to servo such that the object tied to other end of thread will press the nob)
* **Ultrasonic distance sensor** is used basically to avoid obstacles !!
* **PIR sensor** is used to detect human beings when they are in front of car and sanitize them. 
## Progress
Hardware part is yet to be done!!

Code is here https://github.com/rcp24/Road-sanitization-project/blob/master/sanitizer_dispenser_car_1.ino 
>_Code is self explanatory_

Any ideas for improvement are always welcome !!

### **Thank You!!**
